# Waste-classification
This project aims to develop a CNN-based system that automatically classifies waste into categories like plastic, paper, metal, and e-waste from images. It enhances recycling efficiency, reduces manual effort, and promotes smart, sustainable waste management through AI-driven automation.
The rapid growth of population, urbanization, and industrialization has led to an alarming increase in solid waste generation. Improper waste segregation at the source poses a major environmental challenge, resulting in inefficient recycling processes, pollution, and health hazards. Manual waste sorting is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often inaccurate. Therefore, there is a critical need for an automated and intelligent system that can classify waste efficiently and accurately, supporting sustainable waste management and recycling initiatives.

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based waste classification model capable of identifying and categorizing waste from images. CNNs are a class of deep learning models particularly effective for image analysis and pattern recognition, as they automatically extract spatial and visual features from raw image data. The system will classify waste into predefined categories such as plastic, paper, glass, metal, organic, and e-waste, enabling better segregation at the source.

To build this model, a dataset of labeled waste images will be collected and preprocessed using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the model’s performance and robustness. The CNN architecture will then be trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable classification results.

By automating the waste classification process, the system can significantly reduce human intervention, increase sorting accuracy, and improve the overall efficiency of recycling operations. When integrated with smart technologies like IoT-enabled bins or camera-based recognition systems, it can facilitate real-time waste identification and automated segregation.

This project aims to contribute toward smart and sustainable waste management systems, promoting environmental conservation and efficient resource utilization. Through the integration of artificial intelligence and computer vision, the proposed CNN-based approach can transform traditional waste management into a more eco-friendly, automated, and data-driven process, supporting the global vision of cleaner cities and sustainable living.
